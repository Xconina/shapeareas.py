Analysis
    I need a program that computes the area of a triangle, rectangle, and circle. The user will input specs about shapes so
    the areas can be calculated.

Specs
    Triangle- Inputs(base, height)
            - Outputs(area= 1/2 * base * height)
    Rectangle- Inputs(width, height)
            -Outputs(area= width * height)
    Circle- Inputs(radius)
            -Outputs(area= pi * radius**2)

Design
    import math
    define triangle function (def areaTriangle)
    return area of triangle when function called 
    define rectangle function (def areaRectangle)
    return area of rectangle when function called
    define circle function
    return area of circle when function called

    def main()
    print("This program computes the area of a triangle, rectangle, and circle")
    prompt user for base and height of triangle
    call areaTriangle
    Print area
    prompt user for width and height of rectangle
    call areaRectangle
    print area
    prompt user for radius of circle
    call areaCircle
    print area

    import math


    def areaTriangle(base, height):
        area = 1/2 * base * height
        return area

    def areaRectangle(width, height):
        area= width * height
        return area

    def areaCircle(radius):
        area= math.pi * radius**2
        return area

    def main():
        print("This program computes the area of a triangle, rectangle, and circle.")
        print("")

        print("Triangle")
        base = float(input("Enter base:"))
        theight = float(input("Enter height:"))
        print("The area is=", "{:.2f}".format(areaTriangle(base, theight)))
        print("")

        print("Rectangle")
        width = float(input("Enter width:"))
        rheight = float(input("Enter height:"))
        print("The area is=", "{:.2f}".format(areaRectangle(width, rheight)))
        print("")

        print("Circle")
        radius = float(input("Enter radius:"))
        print("the area is=","{:.2f}".format(areaCircle(radius)))


Debugging
    I designed the triangle part first. It took some time to figure out exactly how to get it to work. At first I wasn't defining how 
    to get the area and to return the area when defining areaTriangle. After I figured this out, the rest went smoothly. My only other issue
    was getting pi to work. I just needed to call the math library through math.pi
